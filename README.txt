The Hilbert Curve expressed by a rewrite system (L-system)
-----------------
Alphabet : A, B
Constants : F + −
Axiom : A
Production rules:
A → +BF−AFA−FB+
B → −AF+BFB+FA−

Here, "F" means "draw forward", "+" means "turn left 90°", "-" means "turn right 90°",
 and "A" and "B" are ignored during drawing.
